Week __ of __ weeks <br>
<!--HOW WOULD THIS WORK? DO I PULL THIS INFORMATION FROM THE DATABASE, OR IS THIS SOMETHING I SET IN PHP OR HTML 5 WITH THE DATE? I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE FORM I COULD FILL OUT FOR EACH 4DX FOCUS WE DO. IT WOULD ASK QUESTIONS LIKE: WHAT IS THE FOCUS? WHAT IS THE WIS? WHEN IS THE STARTING DATE? WHEN IS THE ENDING DATE? HOW MANY WEEKS WILL THE FOCUS LAST? ARE THERE ANY VACATION WEEKS? IDEA IS TO HAVE 4DXWAG, 4DXWIS, 4DXAdmin-->

<!-- I need to learn how to extract and manipulate data from mysql the ?X? would pull from mysql how many weeks remaining -->
<!-- 2 POINTS 1) I'm only wanting this question to appear after weeks 3, 6 and 9 and 2) I see how to do drop-down here. Will the variable "Progress" hold the value of whatever choice is chosen? Instead of word description value would he be better to put a number value so the given values could calculate the teams feeling about reaching the goal. -->
