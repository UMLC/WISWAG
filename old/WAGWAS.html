HERE WOULD BE PRINTED THE WILDLY IMPORTANT STANDARD (WIS)<br>
4DX Weekly Action Goal (WAG)<br>
Week __ of __ weeks <br>
<!--HOW WOULD THIS WORK? DO I PULL THIS INFORMATION FROM THE DATABASE, OR IS THIS SOMETHING I SET IN PHP OR HTML 5 WITH THE DATE? I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE FORM I COULD FILL OUT FOR EACH 4DX FOCUS WE DO. IT WOULD ASK QUESTIONS LIKE: WHAT IS THE FOCUS? WHAT IS THE WIS? WHEN IS THE STARTING DATE? WHEN IS THE ENDING DATE? HOW MANY WEEKS WILL THE FOCUS LAST? ARE THERE ANY VACATION WEEKS? IDEA IS TO HAVE 4DXWAG, 4DXWIS, 4DXAdmin-->

Did you modify the scoreboard to reflect your progress?
<br>
With ?X? weeks left to "?this needs to be specified goal?" I'm feeling ... <!-- I need to learn how to extract and manipulate data from mysql the ?X? would pull from mysql how many weeks remaining -->
<!-- 2 POINTS 1) I'm only wanting this question to appear after weeks 3, 6 and 9 and 2) I see how to do drop-down here. Will the variable "Progress" hold the value of whatever choice is chosen? Instead of word description value would he be better to put a number value so the given values could calculate the teams feeling about reaching the goal. -->
<select name="Progress">
    <option value="surpass">we may surpass our goal</option>
    <option value="confident">confident we will make our goal</option>
    <option value="hopeful">behind, but hopeful we can reach our goal</option>
    <option value="doubtful">behind, and doubtful we can reach our goal</option>
</select>

I attained our wildly important standard: Yes!<input type="radio" name="Met" value="Met"> No<input type="radio" name="Met" value="Unmet" checked><br> 

<!--At the end of the last week, the above radio button should show and the data will go into the table "standard" AND the information that follows should not show -->

My WAG for Monday, "Month date EXTRACT" through Friday, "Month Date EXTRACT":<br>

This action will take place <input type="number" min=01 max=99 name="PerDay"> times per day and <input type="number" min=01 max=06 name="days"> days per week.<br>

<!-- When does the function of PerDay*PerWeek take place and become the variable "$Times" that will go into the db? The PerDay and Perweek are not important-->
